    | Based in Melbourne, Australia, I have built my career on top of a strong
    | foundation in visual art. After completing further study in communication
    | design and small business management, I started my own design business,
    | working with a wide range of small businesses and independent clients. I
    | have also worked with digital agencies, corporate clients, and online
    | start-ups.

    | I am a nerdy upskiller. Over the years Iâ€™ve never stopped learning. My
    | toolbox has grown to include some front end development skills, service
    | design, digital design, and teaching.
  p
    | I once delivered a workshop on making fairy flower-crowns at a
    | six-year-old kidâ€™s birthday party in costume when I lived in Hanoi. 
    | I will go above and beyond to deliver creative services and unique
    | customer experiences

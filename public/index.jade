    Iâ€™m a design thinker. I solve problems and design beautiful experiences, while balancing user needs with business objectives. I create products that are useful. I workshop ideas, collaborate with clients and teams, and tell stories with well executed documentation. All of this is built on a strong foundation in visual design and creative arts.

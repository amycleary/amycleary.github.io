      Iâ€™m a design thinker. I solve problems and design beautiful experiences, while balancing user needs with business objectives. I create products that are useful. I workshop ideas, collaborate with clients and teams, and tell stories with well executed documentation. Add this to a strong background in visual design and creative arts, and you have yourself a very useful _interdisciplinary_ UXer.
